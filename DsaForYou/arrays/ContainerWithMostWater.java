/**
 * Container With Most Water problem solution.
 * 
 * <p>This class provides a solution to find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container
 * that can hold the most water. The solution uses a two-pointer approach for optimal performance.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
 * <p>Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
 * n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
 * Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Key Insights:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Area between two lines is determined by the shorter line and the distance between them</li>
 *   <li>Two-pointer technique helps in optimizing from O(nÂ²) to O(n) time complexity</li>
 *   <li>Always move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inwards</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Time Complexity:</h2>
 * <p>O(n) - Single pass through the array with two pointers</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Space Complexity:</h2>
 * <p>O(1) - Only constant extra space is used</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Common Interview Questions:</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>How would you approach this problem with a brute force solution?</li>
 *   <li>Why does moving the pointer at the shorter line work?</li>
 *   <li>Can you think of a case where this approach would fail?</li>
 *   <li>How would you modify this to find the actual lines instead of just the area?</li>
 * </ol>
